## Overview

This site is intended to be my footprint on the internet. It serves two purposes, firstly as a professional hub for job hunting and networking and secondly as a location to show off all the cool stuff I've made. I haven't done a great job preserving my data and this repository will provide a more reliable archive. You can view the site at www.mhwinder.com

## Site Content

The main page has tiles that link to static pages, social media accounts, or directories of additional content.

- About Me - A static page with some photos and a brief Bio
- Resume - A PDF copy of my resume
- Linkedin/Github/Medium/Github/Youtube - Links to social media
- Fun with HTML canvas - Several small programs that use the canvas element as a starting point
- Old Webpages - A place to keep my older webpages and some links to family pages.

## Further work

The canvas background element is intended to scale to the browser window but it doesn't work how I wanted it to. Plus there are problems with mobile. The desired effect is just an animated background with no other impact to the foreground web content.

The tiles on the main page are fixed size and don't consider window size. I was going for a "mobile" style app select screen but I think it needs tweaking.

Automate uploading changes to github and the webhost for the site. As I write this I'm putting off uploading all the changes to the host.
