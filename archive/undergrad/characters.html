Lord Bezneg
D&D
Senior HS
CHARACTER INFO
   Dwarf
   Middle Age (~120)
   LE
   Telepath
</pre>
DESCRIPTION
<p>   Bezneg was evil to the core. He despised everyone who wasn't a psion, and even most psions. He lead an uprising in a small kingdom with his student, a psyblade known as "The Deviant". Although the campaign ended without world domination, Bezneg would have found great joy in bringing the world to its knees under his rule (through the face of The Deviant). His telepathic abilities aided him in controling his many followers (we had an army for crying out loud) but he did have two loyal cohorts. Both goons never did much, but an evil leader has goons, c'mon.</p>
OTHER INFO
<p>   The campaign began with Bezneg and The Deviant (and Billy's character who we killed several times (Billy is sort of retarded)) sitting in a tavern (The Inn of Goodly Goodness I believe it was) when a gaurd ran in asking for help defending the town from bandits. We accepted, but once getting to the bandits we took control of the bandits and brought the town to its knees. Oddly enough we ended up joining another towns militia, then slaughtered our own disorganized bandits to gain status in a more official army. </p>

<pre>
Boy Scout
D20 Modern
Freshman UNH
CHARACTER INFO
   Human
   16
   LG
   Dedicated Hero, Smart Hero, Charismatic Hero
</pre>
DESCRIPTION
<p>   This character was a well prepared kid, thrown into a post apocolyptic hell. He was a coward, and couldn't fight off the zombie hoards, but damnit he had a camera and could snap photos of the action (including several readied actions that caught some crit misses! LAWL). His spot skill was off the charts which was great for not being jumped by zombies or for being lookout, plus he knew wilderness survivle and first aid! He sure was a good scout!</p>
OTHER INFO
<p>   He tried to form a scout troop, but everyone died in a horrible mission gone awry. His leadership wasn't very good =/</p>
<a name="durmin"></a><br><br>
<pre>
Durmin
D&D
Junior HS
CHARACTER INFO
   Dwarf
   Old (180+)
   LG
   Cloistered Cleric
</pre>
DESCRIPTION
<p>   Durmin is always happy reading a book by a warm hearth, or telling a fable to a group of eager youngsters. Durmin has never been too far down the military training of his clan, but thats the only thing he hasn't done. This dwarf knows far more than any of his clansman and is respected for it. While his brothers were off making names forthemselves as craftsmen and soldiers he studied and prayed to Moradin. He is proud of his families accomplishments, but his family is also proud of his great wisdom and knowledge.</p>
RECYCLES
<p>   I never played this character in D&D. I NPCed him once for a few sessions and I played him as a Dwarf Priest in WOW, He got to ~level 43.</p>
<a name="dwarfr"></a><br><br>
<pre>
Dwarf Ranger/Barbarian/Fighter/Sorcerer
D&D
Junior HS
CHARACTER INFO
   Dwarf
   ????
   CN
   Ranger 2/Barbarian 2/Fighter 1/Sorcerer 1
</pre>
DESCRIPTION
<p>   This guy was insane. He had a cat familiar that he talked to frequently. He was always searching for some strange place where his cat wanted him to go (sopposedly there was magic catnip or something). His combat ability was good, he could cast enlarge person on himself then enrage for some massive damage. Damn good Fort saves too.</p>
OTHER INFO
   Too bad he dies the same session I joined the pary. Thats okay cause the campaign ended that day anyway.</p>
<a name="felinb"></a><br><br>
<pre>
Felinbek Stonefoot
D&D
Junior HS
CHARACTER INFO
   Dwarf
   Young (50's)
   NG?
   Evoker (Wizard specialty BOOM)
</pre>
DESCRIPTION
<p>   Felinbek was a wizard with style. He always had his wide brimmed red feathered hat. His flashy "I'm the man" attitude was reflected by the hat. He had a Raven familiar named Thewk who could talk. Felinbek ended up roasting in a fireball in a tight dungeon corridor.</p>
<a name="gartel"></a><br><br>
<pre>
Gartel Eribin
D&D - Dragonlance
Sophmore UNH
CHARACTER INFO
   Dwarf
   187 (2 years below old)
   Good (no law-chaos axis)
   Fighter
</pre>
DESCRIPTION
<p>   This dwarf is a dwarfs dwarf (e.g. Mans man). He is old, but still kicking as much evil-ass as any young spry dwarf would like. He's been on quest after quest since leaving his military position in [name of dragonlance dwarf homeland] although, he definitly spends some of his time back at home training the youngsters. He is mainly a free agent, wandering the world cleaning up goblin brigands and draconian squads where he goes. He is no fool though, as far as raw stats, he is as strong as smart, and wiser than that. He is definitly a dwarf that the kids would someday like to be: fierce in combat, wise in culture, and skilled in craft (his is masonry).</p>
<a name="ikbaro"></a><br><br>
<pre>
Ikbar of the Smouldering Seas of Gouldune
Mutants and Masterminds
Sophmore UNH
CHARACTER INFO
   Imp
   time exists in only vague ways
   evil
   classless system
</pre>
DESCRIPTION
<p>   "I am Ikbar of the Smouldering Seas of Gouldune, cower before me mortal because I will soon rule this insignifacant world!". Thus is the shallow claim of Ikbar. He escaped hell with the simple goal of enslaving all of the moral relm, because damnit whipping wrathful sinners gets old after an eternity or two. Ikbars plans are well on their way as he already has a position on Argotopia's city council and a lucrative trade agreement with Adidas. Ikbar is actually the overlord of the Smouldering Seas of Gouldune, but it is only a small province of the 7th level of hell, and Ikbar wants more. The Mayor, Ikbars new master (Imps are quick to grovel to supreme power), probably won't end up taking over the world, but Ikbar will definitely try to tilt the tables in that direction.</p>
<a name="kezbek"></a><br><br>
<pre>
Kezbek Ironborn
D&D - Dragonlance
Junior HS
CHARACTER INFO
   Dwarf
   Young
   CN
   Barbarian
</pre>
DESCRIPTION
<p>   If you need an angry, non-traditional, and violent dwarf, you've found him. Kezbek is the dwarf that you can COUNT on starting that bar brawl. Its not that he wasn't accepted in hs clan, he just started walking one day, then he hit the ocean and started sailing. He was smaller than the minotaur, but his axe was the same size as theirs!</p>
RECYCLES
<p>   Kezbek was my Dwarf paladin in WOW. I RPed him with the above personality (as a paladin!).</p>
OTHER INFO
<p>   I took a personality test with him. He got 19 counts of chaotic (and some evil mixed in) but damnit he broke the chaotic scale, he was too chaotic to even be trusted to be evil.</p>
<a name="kleffi"></a><br><br>
<pre>
Kleff Ironblood
D&D
Sophmore UNH
CHARACTER INFO
   Dwarf
   Young
   CN
   Bard
</pre>
DESCRIPTION
<p>   This dwarf generaly didn't care about anyone. He fit in well in dwarf society because those fools would believe anything. He was a military engineer until he failed horribly in battle then got exiled, Meh, humans can be tricked too. Its better to run than hide, this character has some flare that shouldn't be soiled on the ground or in a bush (unless he was invisible!). His performance specialty was poetry, and damnit if he wasn't going to write the most famous poem of all time. People would talk about his hero's for ages to come. He would define peoples images of glory, and reap huge profits in the process.</p>
OTHER INFO
<p>   I tried to write some poetry for this character, damn its hard.</p>

Mitch Frankson
White Wolf
Sophmore UNH
CHARACTER INFO
   Human
   30's
   Caregiver - Conformist
   Mage - Acaustic Brotherhood
</pre>
DESCRIPTION
<p>   Mitch is a nice guy, he would never want to cause anyone any trouble, while at the same time he manages to cause more problems than anyone else (I blame the GM's rediculous stricness). Mitch worked in lots of odd jobs, all unskilled, until one day when he inherited a mansion and a magical adventure full of rape and horrer insued. Mitch had the hilarious habit of repeating lines said to him frequently and at hilarious moments. This habit worked well for a dumb-as-a-doornail character like Mitch. I like to picture a white version of the guy from green mile (with hair).</p>
<a name="notacr"></a><br><br>
<pre>
NAC - Not A Crow (I never named this character)
BESM
Sophmore UNH
CHARACTER INFO
   Blackbird
   4
   CN
   Adventurer
</pre>
DESCRIPTION
<p>   This loveable birdy is the perfect compliment to any anime cast. I ripped the personality from Kamo-Kun (Negima!?) and Kon (Bleach). NAC got his human intelligence from a little girls science experiment, and after being graded he was only given a lousy C+!!! He later on involved himself in the interesting affair of several students. He was further experimented on and is now permenantly yellow. His grudge will not die easily. The quote that I started this whole list to remember was: "Nobody steps on me unless I jump under their foot!", which directly relates to this character, although, he hasn't been trying to get shot at and smacked sky high in game (out of game it was my objective). He would often say "tweet". Feel free to visit the Tweet Gallery located <a href="besm.html">HERE</a>. Update: NAC is now pink, the universe hates him.</p>
RECYCLES
<p>   NAC shows up in the Mutants and Masterminds campaign that <a href="#ikbaro">Ikbar of the Smouldering Seas of Gouldune</a> is a character from. NAC shows up when people roll nat 1's and usually causes bad stuff to befall the players.</p>
<a name="oliver"></a><br><br>
<pre>
Oliver W. North
White Wolf
Sophmore UNH
CHARACTER INFO
   Human
   27
   Bravo
   Hunter turned Mage (thats a funny story)
</pre>
DESCRIPTION
<p>   Oliver North had a starring role in the sci-fi series StarHunter 5, which ran for 3 seasons and build up a cult fanbase before being canceled. His character Corpral Rinder will be described later on, and I fully intend to PLAY Rinder in a sci-fi campagn. After that he could never get a serious role outside of his sci-fi typecast. Its really a shame, cause he was a damn good actor. He was imbued with the powers of a hunter to kill the undead and werewolves, but he resisted all the way. His eventual awakening as a mage was self induced. He got enough people (and the right people) to truely believe he was a mage, then reality guessed, he ought to be a mage (that plan sure backfired).</p>
OTHER INFO
<p>   Corpral Rinder is a true hero. Rinder was never in charge, but when trouble showed up, it was Rinder who ended up saving the day through sheer grit, determination and luck. There was even a touching episode where Rinder didn't accept a promotion so he could stay onboard the StarHunter 5 and with the other trusted castmembers.</p>
<a name="timthe"></a><br><br>
<pre>
Tim
BESM
Sophmore UNH
CHARACTER INFO
   Human
   11
   Good
   Adventurer
</pre>
DESCRIPTION
<p>   Tim is a happy 11 year old anime kid. This means he has awesome martial arts skills and a hugely destructive hidden power. He has had a large golden amulet since as long as he can remember, it was a gift from his dead mother and he refuses to take it off ever. Thats lucky because if he ever does he transforms into a giant bearlike monster and rips and tears everything around him until somebody gets it back to him. He never fit in at school because of his horns (yeah, he has horns) so he learned everything he knows from his Sensei who is, of course, thousands of years old and posseses an anime amount of power.</p>
<a name="tobinr"></a><br><br>
<pre>
Tobin Redfeather
D&D - Dragonlance
Senior HS
CHARACTER INFO
   Kender
   30? There is an age when all Kender wander
   CN
   Rogue
</pre>
DESCRIPTION
<p>   Kender only have one personality. I played Tobin the only way I believe kender should be played. I found items in my inventory that werent there before. I would erase things of my allies character sheets when they took a piss. I feinted so every attack was a sneak attack (OMG it was an undead campaign!!). I was always cheerful and I had a high pitch voice to prove it. Dagger, mace, whoopak and some very sharp words were all a tool to be used. I stole a key from a gaurd then climbed the wall and asked him to let me out. I don't like kender personality, but it sure was fun.</p>
