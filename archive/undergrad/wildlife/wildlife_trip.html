<H2>Trips and Activities</H2>

<H2>Winter Tracking Trips</H2>

<p>learn to track wildlife in the snow. In 2006 we found a place in Maine that teaches tracking during the winter. A large group of club members attended and had a blast tracking bobcat, coyote, porcupine and flying squirrel.</p>

<H2>Moose Check Station</H2>

<p>Visit moose (or deer) check station during fall hunting season. During the hunt all animals killed have to be brought to a check station to be weighed, measured, and aged by a biologist. A large group went in 2006 and we’ll return fall of 07! Learn how to age moose by their teeth and try your hand at weighing them!</p>

<H2>Freshwater Salmon Fishery</H2>

<p>Trips to freshwater Salmon Fishery to help harvest salmon eggs. These will be hatched in tanks and released into NH rivers to help return the salmon to historic waters and increase populations.</p>

<H2>Annual Wildlife Society Conclave</H2>

<p>Annual Wildlife Society Conclave – hosted by a different northeastern University every year. For those intending to work in wildlife or conservation related fields this is an amazing opportunity. Meet professionals and other students in your field, and learn about field techniques you might not learn in school. For everyone else the activities, such as wildlife photography, tracking, and radio-telemetry, and the chance to spend a weekend with people who enjoy wildlife as much as you do, is a lot of fun!</p>

<H2>Beaver Trapping </H2>

<p>Attend the beaver trapping demonstration held in NH every year. Most people have no idea how traps work, this is your chance to learn from professionals! Learn all about making scents, setting traps, and running a trap line. And if you’re lucky the traps will be successful and you’ll get to enjoy beaver stew!</p>

<H2>Moose Tracking</H2>

<p>Track radio-collared moose. We usually do this in late winter or early spring. The batteries in the collars are slowly going but we might have a few years left to track them down, or find a collar that fell off! Learn how radio telemetry works and have fun tromping around the woods on moose trails. In 2007 we saw snowshoe hare and woodpeckers.</p>
