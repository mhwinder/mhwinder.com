<H2>About Us</H2>

<p>The Wildlife Society (TWS), founded in 1937, is an international non-profit organization of professionals active in wildlife research, management, education, and administration. TWS aims to develop and promote sound stewardship of wildlife resources and environments upon which wildlife and humans depend.</p>

<H2>Meetings</H2>
<p>Every other Wednesday in James Hall Rm. 104 at 6:30pm</p>

<H2>More Info</H2>

<p>The UNH chapter of the Wildlife Society is a recognized student organization. There is no fee to join and all activities are either free or very low cost. We run trip to learn about/view wildlife, bring speakers and documentaries to campus, and run educational programs at local elementary schools.</p> 

<p>New Hampshire has an amazing variety of native wildlife to see in all seasons and the members of the Wildlife Society are always at work planning upcoming trips. Come to a meeting and find out what’s going on!</p>

<p>Everyone is welcome at all events. It doesn’t matter your major, art, english, math or chemistry, all are welcome. All that is required is an active interest in wildlife.</p> 

<p>In addition for those going into wildlife or environment oriented fields the Wildlife Society is an excellent place to meet people and train skills like tracking and radio telemetry that aren’t learned in the classroom. The yearly Conclave of all Northeast Wildlife Society student chapters is a great opportunity to make connections, find possible internships, and learn about areas of wildlife research difficult to find in school.</p>
