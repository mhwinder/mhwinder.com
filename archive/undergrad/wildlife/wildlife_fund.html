<H2>Annual Game Dinner</H2>

<p>Annual Game Dinner - our biggest fundraiser! A wide variety of donated game and a few veggie dishes. People from all over New Hampshire (and a few other places) who support wildlife activities and education donate game for our annual fundraiser. The Wildlife Society and volunteers (often including a few professors) cook and everyone has a good time. This event is held on campus with a wide variety of meats. Ever wanted to try moose? T-shirts are sold and raffles are held.</p>
