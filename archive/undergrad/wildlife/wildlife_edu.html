<H2>Educational Programs</H2>

<p>The Wildlife Society is a conservation oriented group and we believe that education is the key to harmony between people and the environment. Our members design and run several educational programs aimed at teaching elementary school children about the native wildlife of their state.</p>

<p>Our programs include basic information on predator prey relationships, winter survival, and migration. There are six programs total, each one dealing with a different ecosystem and set of species from urban areas to the deep forests to wetlands. We use hands-on learning whenever possible including games designed to help children understand predator-pray roles, we also bring in specimens (pelts, bones) so that children can see and touch species they may never see in the wild.</p>
