<h2>Star Hunter Equipment</h2>
<p><h3>Armaments</h3> 
- A Star Hunter is equipped with forward and rear missile launch stations. These missiles are specially designed for zero G, no atmosphere conditions. The missiles have several tracking modes including heat seeking, magnetic attraction, remote piloting and AI control. At ideal conditions the ship should be able to launch four missiles every 30 seconds, two forward and two backward. There are conventional and nuclear missiles, orders are to not worry about polluting space with radiation if the ship is in danger.</p>
<p>A Star Hunter also has top and bottom mounted laser/projectile gun turrets. The turrets have almost full coverage of all space, but there are a few blind spots along the sides and back in the same plane as the ship. Laser weaponry is less useful due too the high energy cost and the less reliable systems, although it is faster traveling and more damaging. It is unknown how useful the projectile weapons will be in space when fighting at large distances.</p>
<p><h3>Atomic Construct Chamber</h3> 
- This device is able to construct materials and objects from the atom up. Simple homogenous substances like metals, glass or water are simple to make, and many important hardware items like circuits, and ammunition are preprogrammed into the system. Biological substances are extremely complex from an atomic level but most common foods like beef and flour have been designed and are available to be made.</p>
<p><h3>Communication</h3> 
- The main communication system to earth is the Paired Signal Transmitter. The transmitter sends a message to its sister transmitter on earth. This device transmits signals to its paired device from any distance instantaneously. The technology is fairly antiquated, but hasn't found much use on earth because, as its discoverer stated, "Light is fast enough."  Messages can only be sent in one direction at a time so there are two.</p>
<p>
<h3>Defense Systems</h3>
 - The Star Hunter contains an anti-radiation and anti-electromagnetic field that extends from the ship 100 meters. These fields will protect the ship from most hazards in space as well as small energy weapons fire. The laser turrets are more powerful then the field and can be fired out unless the field is run at 150% or more priority. The hull itself is 0.5 meters thick of high resistance alloy that would repel almost as much radiation and small arms as the defense field does.</p>
 <p>The interior contains a security lock down and stun turret system for use by the captain and vice-captain only. The external field can be inverted for internal use, but significantly hinders its external use when in this set up.</p>
 <p><h3>Faster than Light Propulsion Engine</h3> - The Faster than Light Propulsion Engine has undergone significant testing since its initial development but is still in a very experimental phase. It is believed to be able reach speeds of 1000c but the test unit that went that fast was never recovered. Safe operational use is anywhere from 5c to 500c.</p>
<p><h3>Gravitational Repulsion Engine</h3> - This engine was the standard mode of transportation on and around earth for the past 200 years. These engines haven't fully replaced the electric motors on all ground based vehicles but air and spacecraft all use one. The custom G Engines used by the Star Hunter can travel up to 1000 m/s near the earth and moon, but would be larger near larger masses. The G Engine works by manipulating strong gravitational fields near large masses and is therefore useless in deep space.</p>

<h2>Personnel Equipment</h2>
<p><h3>Armaments</h3> 
- Anyone on board a Star Hunter is authorized to carry a stun pistol. The stun pistol is a low power energy weapon that only temporarily disables a human target. How these weapons will effect alien targets is unknown. It doesn't have the power to breach a portable defense field. The Star Hunter also launches with 10 laser assault rifles and 10 projectile assault rifles in its armory. Additional weaponry can be constructed at any time that includes flamethrowers, rocket launchers, grenades and anything else you might want to use to kill things. Many chemical weapons can be made but no biological weapons. Only the captain, vice-captain and chief military officer have access to the weapons listing for the Construction Chamber.</p>
<p><h3>Communication</h3> 
- All members of the crew are required to have a small portable device called Communications Identification (C-ID). A C-ID continuously transmits a signal that can reach 5 km. This device also includes basic sensors for radiation and EM waves and other C-ID signals. Additional sensors and features can be added at users request. These devices are used like dog tags in the military, but civilians who have them often use them as a wristwatch or keep them in their wallet. These devices have been embedded into eyeglasses.</p>
<p>
<h3>Defense Systems</h3>
 - The space suits on the Star Hunter are designed for use on planet surfaces and for combat as well. They include similar personal defense fields as the ship itself and optionally body armor to protect from smaller projectile weapons. The suits are extremely durable and bullets will likely kill the wearer with blunt trauma before the airtight seal is broken. Portable defense fields are cylinders about 10cm long and 2cm in diameter and are used when working on the FTL Engines just in case of breach.</p>
 <p><h3>Transportation</h3> 
- A Star Hunter has four ten-man shuttles equipped for traveling in and around planets. The Star Hunter itself can travel in atmosphere as easily as the shuttles so these are not the only surface transports. They use G Engines so are useless in deep space and are fairly standard as far as spacecraft. Two of them have attached laser/projectile turrets similar to the ones the Star Hunters have but they can be modified in under an hour to switch between armed and unarmed vehicles as needed. The armed vehicles can only carry 8 people.</p>
