<p>Star Hunter 5 began as a fictional TV show in a fictional world.</p>
<p>I role-played a character in a white wolf campaign, the character was Oliver North. He was the star of a sci-fi TV show Star Hunter 5. You can find more about Oliver North (Corporal Rinder) <a href="starhunter_characters.html">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>I plan on Running a Star Hunter 5 role-playing game some time in the future, and this page is preparation for that.</p>
<br>
<p>I won't run this campaign fall semester '07. The reason is because I'm taking astrophysics and I want the science fiction to be as good as possable.</p>

<h2>Things that must exist in the Star Hunter world:</h2>
<p>Rinder must say the word "Jugs" in reference to boobs.</p>
<p>Space helmets must be used.</p>
<p>Ensign Jenkins is a character who is a little girl.</p>
