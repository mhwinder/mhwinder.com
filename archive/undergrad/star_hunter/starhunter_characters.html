<h2>Main Cast</h2>
<p><h3>Corporal Rinder (Oliver North)</h3> 
- Rinder wasn't selected for the Star Hunter 5 crew because of his excellent performance at the Academy. He wasn't chosen because of heroic decoration and service. Rinder just happened to be the person carrying the documents to the desk of the selection committee and added himself to the list. Rinder wasn't about to miss a part of the greatest adventure of mankind!</p>
<p><h3>Pilot (Katt Brennan)</h3> - Katt has claimed this position.</p>
<p><h3>Head Engineer (PC)</h3> - </p>
<p><h3>Diplomat (PC)</h3> - </p>
<p><h3>Chief Military Officer (PC)</h3> - </p>
<p><h3>Biologist Conrad Maynard (Josh Collins)</h3> - Biology Scientist for SH5.</p>
<p><h3>Geologist (PC)</h3> - </p>


<h2>Supporting Cast</h2>
<p><h3>Captain Jerold Denison (Mike Hanson)</h3> 
- Captain Denisons career took a turn for the worst 5 years ago when a huge criminal organization was discovered under his nose. Denison was forced to give up his position to Paul Conners who discovered the crime ring, but he stayed in as an advisor to Conners till he was appointed captain of Star Hunter V.</p>
<p><h3>Vice Captain Unrif Paldi(William James)</h3> 
- Paldi was taken from the Mars colony for his experience with space travel and ship technology. While everyone on the ship should know how to pilot the ship, Paldi could fly it in his sleep. Paldi is a true maritime professional.</p>
<p><h3>Chief Science Officer Nel Immanyull(Ken Hijimihad)</h3>
 - Immanyull worked on Neptune for the past 30 years and was vital for learning the inner workings of the gas planet although he was not the head of the program. Immanyull is the CSO for SH5 and several of his colligues from the same deep space mission were chosen for Positions on SH1 and SH6. He was chosen for his knowledge as well as his familiarity with space flight. </p>
<p><h3>Astronomer J. Alfred Prufrock (Mark Windsor)</h3>
 - J. Alfred Prufrock is a timid astronomer who isn't really known outside of the astronomy field. None the less among his peers he is well respected, but not particularly admired. Nobody has much to say about Dr. Prufrock. His disertation on deep space gravitational phenomina is really great, trust me.</p>
<p><h3>Assistant Diplomat Bur Effeir(Joseph Winslow)</h3>
 - Arrogant bastard, linguistics expert. The previous sentence was put there to be temporary, but I like it and it is gonna stay that way. His nationality is "European".</p>
<p><h3>Sergeant Styg Nefkins (John Douglas)</h3>
 - Sgt. Nefkins is Rinders Superior officer. Nefkins likes to follow military protocol, which means the very existance of Rinder upsets his world and puts a rock in his boot (This will happen literally). Sgt. Nefkins is your typical GI man, although Rinder my wqear him down into showing some new colors if I run out of episode ideas.</p>
<p><h3>Co-Pilot Randy Westward(Jim Sandson)</h3> 
- The Co-Pilot will be a cowboy-esque guy who is good pals with Rinder. There definitely won't be any times where they hijack guns and a shuttle and have their own solo adventure!</p>
<p><h3>Communications Officer Nyra Taoler(Alison Freeman)</h3>
 - Taoler is a strong dignified woman who isn't afraid to slap. Aside from that what else do you need to know? Oh, she does have a nice rack.</p>
 <p><h3>Navigation Officer Hink Crawden(Hank Timler)</h3> - Dr. Crawden is a young scientist who was chosen for the Star Hunter mission because he is familiar with the layout of the Galaxy as well as the engineering of the new FTL propulsion technology. This is the guy who will be manning the light speed travel. His friends call him Hinkles, that is if he had any friends. You might call him a nerd.</p>


<h2>Other</h2>
<p><h3>Captain Paul Conners (Al Hammond)</h3> 
- Paul Conners is the greatest law enforcement hero earth has. He discovered a massive criminal organization and brought it down. At the time he was low in the law enforcement ladder, but his success took him straight to the top. He replaced Gerald Denison as head of United America's Law Enforcement division. He was chosen to be the captain of Star Hunter III.</p>
<p><h3>Ensign Jenkins (Alice Green)</h3>
 - Ensign Jenkins is a child prodigy that joins the Star Hunter 5 crew at the beginning of the second season. Jenkins is 12 years old and I haven't decided if I should put her in engineering or one of the sciences.</p>
<p><h3>Dr. Victor Higgins (Ian White)</h3>
 - Dr. Higgins is the Chief Science Officer on board Star Hunter 1. It was Dr Higgins who reverse engineered the faster than light engine off of the original wreckage. Higgins is 106 years old, making him the oldest member of the crew of any Star Hunter ship. He is widely respected by everyone on earth.</p>
<p><h3>Ground Control (Billy Kingson)</h3>
 - This character is the voice from earth transmissions. Not really important.</p>

Goert Merklinden (he doesn't have any friends), Joller Coster, Big, Small, Iggy, <b>Histogram</b>, The Douglas, Guy, <b>Q-Master</b>, Delta, Mitch, The Letter "T", Fargo, Wolf, and DimeTime</p>
