<p><h3> August 14, 2007 </h3> 
- I added some stuff in the characters page. Made some revisions and such. Notably I added an ass load of nicknames for soldiers (exactly 24 of them actually).</p><br>

<p><h3> August 12, 2007 </h3> 
- I have revamped the rank tree once more. The crew is much larger than before, and I am considering making the Navigation Officer and Communication officer PC options. I'll eventually add a new sidebar catagory for game system information. I don't have the programs for it over here so I can't make the Icon. I made a new text file of game system data. You can check out <a href="game_stats.txt">Game Stats</a> and <a href="game_combat.txt">Combat</a>. Neither is finished, so stay off my back. I also made a few additions and changes to the characters and about pages.</p><br>

<p><h3> July 31, 2007 </h3> 
- I have made changes to the Rank, Characters and Hunters pages. Rank is in a state of disrepair but the important change is that Astronomer is now a reserved NPC and I plan to change the chain of command for the Pilot and Engineer. I will probably add in a Communications officer possably a PC and add in some intermediary officer in charge of the ships maitinence.</p><br>

<p><h3> July 23, 2007 </h3> 
- I have put some of my thoughts about the game system down on paper (and consequently digitized them) <a href="game_stats.txt">HERE</a>. This is not a full picture and you will not be able to see what I intend to do by looking at it. It will help to know that I see main stats as d6's and sub stats as constants added to the dice in order to reach a final number. After being hit by a successful attack, the player will make a withstanding roll to find out how bad he's been hit. Weapons will do 1-3 damage, because your hp won't ever be more than 6. As you lose stamina you will not be able to do stamina related actions as well as a result. Senses will go down if you fail to withstand the hits to stamina, but will go up much faster. People can also do direct damage to senses with stun weapons. As senses goes down you will not be able to fight as effectively because of the lowered initiative and armor class (not the same terms as I will use in the game but the same effect). This is still not exactly what I am thinking ,but its a pretty good picture so far. I don't have numbers tweaked right.</p><br>

<p><h3> July 06, 2007 </h3> 
- I removed all of the cool flash stuff from the Fun Stuff page, making it way less fun. Don't worry though, I added a new page to the main pubpage that has all of the flash apps. I decided that the flash stuff was too off subject and moved it. If you want to find them you can click <a href="../flashpage.html">HERE</a>. </p><br>

<p><h3> June 27, 2007 </h3> 
- Check for the updated Flatland Engine in the Fun Stuff section.</p><br>


<p><h3> June 26, 2007 </h3> 
- The changes I suggested I'd make from the post before I made. I also added two very nice and very stolen images on the mission page. I'm not sure what I will do with them but they sure do look nice. I figure mission is as good a place to put them as any, the poor page has nothing going for it, I need to revize and expand.</p><br>

<p><h3> June 25, 2007 </h3> 
- You've gotta check out my newest flash thingy. I made a box with (x,y) coordinates and the collisions are detected through line intersection math. My eventual goal is to make a first person flatland game, where everything is viewed on a single line. The current incarnation is in the fun stuff section and has sound! Woo! As far as Star Hunter, I want to change "Physical Scientist" into "Geologist" and "Astronomer". I also want to mess around with the stylesheet for more predictable page behaviour (try narrowing the page a lot).</p><br>

<p><h3> June 21, 2007 </h3> 
- I added Rank Tree and Star Hunters too the side bar. I had previously attached those pages to the characters page, but they grew big enough to merit their own placement. I also password protected the episodes page. Sorry, but no meta gaming for you!</p><br>

<p><h3> June 19, 2007 </h3> 
- No more white border around the main content boxes. As far as content, I added to the characters section, and revised a little in the technology and mission pages. I also added a whole page on each of the 6 Star Hunter ships. Mainly what the people think of them. Its all <a href="starhunter_hunters.html">HERE</a>. I also want to make a link to <a href="http://www.andkon.com/arcade/obstacles/arcanecastle/">Arcane Castle</a> which is a sweet flash game.</p><br>

<p><h3> June 18, 2007 </h3> 
- I added a whole ton of awesome stuff in the Technology page. You should definitely remember that stuff because it will save your ass if you know what tools you have at your disposal when a challenge confronts you. I also changed the headings to images like what you see on the navigation bar.</p><br>

<p><h3>June 17, 2007 </h3>
 - The flash video I made isn't quite as cool as the one I made yesterday, but its more flexible and I can edit it to make other 3D models later on. I also worked on the characters page, and added a draft for a tree of ranks. Nothing there is finalized, but I'm pretty happy with it. I also streamlined the CSS (shrinking the file size for this page!) and turned the headings Blue.</p><br>

<p><h3> June 16, 2007 </h3>
 - I made an awesome flash app that took way too long to make and I added some more to the Mission page. Mission is close to done, I'm going to work on the Characters next.</p><br>


<p><h3> June 15, 2007 </h3> 
- I added in another flash application. It may seem stupid and simple compared to my spaceship one, but damnit it was hard to make! I took out the sidebar category "Earth", I'll just roll that info into the mission page. I also added some real content to the Mission page.</p><br>

<p><h3> June 13, 2007 </h3> 
- There are some flash applications I've made over in the fun stuff section that you should check out.</p><br>

<p><h3> June 12, 2007 </h3>
 - I made the nav bar on the side all swanky. I'm having some trouble getting this center box to do what I want, but once I've figured that out I can actually start making content. My to do list looks like follows:</p>
- <div style="display:inline;text-decoration:line-through">Add News to nav bar</div>
<br>
- <div style="display:inline;text-decoration:line-through">Figure out how to make the stars in the news box go away</div><br>
- <div style="display:inline;text-decoration:line-through">Make all the attached pages</div><br>
- <div style="display:inline;text-decoration:line-through">Get this text into courier new font</div><br>
- <div style="display:inline;text-decoration:line-through">Put this page on the interweb</div><br>
- <div style="display:inline;text-decoration:line-through">Link this to my main page</div><br>
- Add content to all the pages<br>
- Learn flash and make a game<br>
<p>I worked on the page a lot and finished some of my bullet items. On some of the side pages there is actually more than a sentence or two filler. Check out "Fun Stuff".</p><br>

<p><h3> June 11, 2007 </h3>
 - I decided to make the website yesterday and I started working on the logo today. I've got lots of things that I can add so I bet eventually this site will be huge. I don't plan on putting up the episode summary for everyone because it's going to be the plot notes for a campaign. I'll have a lot of setting info though (eventually). Stay tuned for updates!</p>
