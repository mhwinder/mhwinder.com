<p><h3>Star Hunter I</h3> 
- The president of United Americas appointed his son to the diplomat position of Star Hunter I. The people on Star Hunter I were chosen not only for skill but charisma as well. Inside the mission command there is a running joke that Star Hunter I is the "Luxury Space Cruise". It is not surprise that Star Hunter I is headed in the opposite direction than the predicted direction of the aliens (based on impact location/time). They will be expected to map their section of space like every other Star Hunter.</p>
<p><h3>Star Hunter II</h3> - I haven't thought of anything special about this ship. I will reserve SH2 as a blank page that I can fill in for plot purposes at any time.</p>
<p><h3>Star Hunter III</h3> - Star Hunter III is what the world thinks of when they think of the Star Hunter mission. The captain of Star Hunter III is Paul Conners, considered a hero by everyone on earth. Conners broke the largest criminal smuggling operation the world had ever seen 5 years before the Star Hunter mission. Star Hunter III is headed in the predicted direction of the aliens.</p>
<p><h3>Star Hunter IV</h3> - Due to political problems and China's refusal to adopt English as the global language, Star Hunter IV is crewed entirely by chinese people. Their captain's name is Chin Wong until I decide a less stereotypical name. It is unlikely that Star Hunter IV will ever accomplish anything or show up in the series.</p>
<p><h3>Star Hunter V</h3> 
- The captain of Star Hunter V is the former head of UA's Law Enforcement branch. He left his post when the public lost confidence in his abilities. He was appointed to captain of Star Hunter V because of Paul Conners recommendation.</p>
<p><h3>Star Hunter VI</h3> - The captain of Star Hunter VI was Gerald Denisons European counterpart. He didn't lose his position from it, but he definitely lost the confidence of a lot of citizens.</p>
