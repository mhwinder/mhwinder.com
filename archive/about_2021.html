      <p>Hi, Thanks for visiting my site. My name is Mike Winder and I've had an interesting path to where I'm at. Before I set my sights on Data Science I had many other hats. I was a teacher, a physicist and a scoutmaster. In a lot of ways I still am all those things. A common line between all these titles is a strong sense of curiosity and adventure along with the desire to share my own excitement and discoveries with others. All of this has lead me to Data Science.</p>

      <p>Scouting taught me what was important and what is just a nice extra. I clearly remember the camping trip I took without a mess kit. I had to eat all my meals out of a cup, with sharpened sticks as my utensils. Just as important is the backpacking trip I took with too many shirts to carry. These lessons are definitely best learned firsthand but as a scoutleader I began developing my teaching style.</p>

      <p>I started studying physics almost as a whim. My first year of college I took a course that was a survey of all the science and engineering majors. I chose physics as kind of a cop out, it seemed like the field with the widest range of subjects. My lessons from scouting applied directly to physics, all I needed to bring was Newtons second law and some calculus and I could solve every problem. This is when I began to identify as a theorist as opposed to an experimentalist. I liked the neat and orderly mathematical side of physics as opposed to the more engineering side</p>

      <p>After college I spent a few years teaching science. It was a good combination of my communication and leadership skills from scouting and my scientific knowledge from university. Running science activities with 8 year old students is an interesting juggling act. I always want the kids to discover the physical processes in their own way because that way it will really stick with them. On the other hand we often work with liquids or other supplies that could cause a mess if/when missused. It was a fun job but when COVID hit the classes stopped.</p>

      <p>I took the General Assembly data science immersive for many of the same reasons that I went for physics. Data Science is a very mathematical field that has applications anywhere and everywhere. In my cohort I met a very diverse group who all had different reasons to be in data science. There were some business people who needed the skills to advance their company and some sports stat enthuseists. Me, I just like the numbers and graphs!</p>

      <p>So here I am! Are you hiring?</p>
